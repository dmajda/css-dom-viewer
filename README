CSS DOM Viewer is a simple browser-based tool that shows a CSS DOM tree built by
a browser for a piece of CSS. It can be used to understand CSS DOM or to verify
CSS parsing behavior in various browsers (e.g. to see if they support some CSS
construction or how they handle errors).

Usage
-----
1. Open the index.html file in your browser.
2. Write CSS to the area on the left-hand side and watch the CSS DOM tree grow
   in the area on the right-hand side.

Note: The index.html cannot be accessed through a file: URL, because the
cross-frame scripting magic wouldn't work correctly then. The workaround is to
move the application into a directory served by a web server (either local or
remote) and access the index.html file via http: URL. Alternatively, you can
switch to the directory with the index.html file an use the "python -m
SimpleHTTPServer" command to serve its contents on localhost:8000.

Browser Support
---------------
* Firefox 3+
* Opera 9.6+

Internet Explorer, Safari and Chrome do not work because they do not let the
tool modify the stylesheet in other frame. If someone knows how to override
this, please let me know.

It is entirely possible that the viewer will work in other browsers or older
browser versions too. The supported browsers and versions are the ones I tested.
