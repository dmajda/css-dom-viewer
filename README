CSS DOM Viewer is a simple browser-based tool that shows a CSS DOM tree built by
a browser for a piece of CSS. It can be used to understand CSS DOM or to verify
CSS parsing behavior in various browsers (e.g. to see if they support some CSS
construction or how they handle errors).

Usage
-----
1. Open the index.html file in your browser.
2. Write CSS to the area on the left-hand side and watch the CSS DOM tree grow
   in the area on the right-hand side.

Browser Support
---------------
* Firefox 3+
* Safari 4+ (tested with public beta)
* Chrome 2+
* Opera 9.6+

It is entirely possible that the viewer will work in other browsers or older
browser versions too. The supported browsers and versions are the ones I tested.
